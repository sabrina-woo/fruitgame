# My Personal Project: Falling Fruit Game

## What will the application do?

The application I will create is a simple game that consists of a **single playable character** that can move left 
and right across the screen. The user's goal is to **collect falling fruit** that moves vertically down the 
screen, and **avoid harmful falling objects** falling vertically down the screen. Upon **hitting a harmful object, 
the game will end**.


## Who will use it?

This game is geared towards **younger children** who would be best able to enjoy the simplistic nature of the game, 
but of course, the game can be played by anyone.

## Why is this project of interest to you?

- Ever since my first coding class, I would find myself interested in how the video games that I play are coded. By 
creating this simplistic game, I can explore the mechanisms that I have been curious about.
- I would like to create something visual, and I believe that creating a simplistic game with this concept 
would allow for a wide range of flexibility/**creative liberty in rendering the final product**.
- As I enjoy playing video games, being able to play the final product would be highly satisfying.
