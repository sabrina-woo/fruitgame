# My Personal Project: Falling Fruit Game

## What will the application do?

The application I will create is a simple game that consists of a **single playable character** that can move left 
and right across the screen. The user's goal is to **collect falling fruit** that moves vertically down the 
screen, and **avoid harmful falling objects** falling vertically down the screen. Upon **hitting three harmful objects, 
the game will end** and a score will be given to the user based on the number of fruits collected by the user. The 
longer the player survives in the game, the more challenging the game will become (eg. more frequent harmful falling 
objects).


## Who will use it?

This game is geared towards **younger children** who would be best able to enjoy the simplistic nature of the game, 
but of course, the game can be played by anyone.

## Why is this project of interest to you?

- Ever since my first coding class, I would find myself interested in how the video games that I play are coded. By 
creating this simplistic game, I can explore the mechanisms that I have been curious about.
- I would like to create something visually appealing, and I believe that creating a simplistic game with this concept 
would allow for a wide range of flexibility/**creative liberty in rendering the final product**.
- As I enjoy playing video games, being able to play the final product would be highly satisfying.

## User Stories

- As a user, I want the game to end after I lose 3 lives.
- As a user, I want to be able to view my number of lives as I lose them.
- As a user, I want to be able to view my score at the end of the game.
- As a user, I want to be able to be able to add fruit to the basket.
- As a user, I want to be able to use the left and right arrow keys to move.
